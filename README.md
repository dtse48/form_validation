This is a basic project demonstrating form validation with JavaScript and PHP. The registration.html and registration.js files are for the JavaScript client-side 
validation demonstration. The registration.php, validate.php, and confirmation.php files are for the PHP server-side validation demonstration. The style.css is an 
optional external stylesheet for webpage appearance.
